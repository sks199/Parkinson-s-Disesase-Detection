# Parkinson-s-Disesase-Detection
Here I have used four models to train the dataset.
* K Nearest Neighbours
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* LinearSVM

Out of these four, the Random Forest model has achieved the best score on the train and test sets. But there seems to be some overfitting with this model.
By choosing Logistic Regression or LinearSVM, this issue can be avoided.
